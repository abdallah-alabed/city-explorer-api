**Author**: Abdallah Alabed

**Version**: 4.0.0
 Sunday 12-9: created the front end interface and created a locaion IQ api interface dependent on the city search from the user.
 monday 13-9: created the back end for my front end and added the weather feature from weatherbit API
 Tuesday 14-9: Added the movies feature from moviesDB API .
 Wednesday 15-9: Refactored my code to modules and controllers and created sub commponents for the weather and the movie features!.
 

## Overview
we are creating a cities exploring website where you enter the name of the city and we display the latitude and longitude and show you the map along with the upcoming weather for the next 16 days! and show any movies that is related to the city itself.

## Getting Started
1- in the search bar search for your destination
2- press explore!
3- a map with latitude and longitude will appear!
4- followed by a 16 day weather status in the city!
5- and any related movies to the city.


## Architecture
we are using JS,ReactJS & bootstrap


## Change Log
12-9-2021 8pm  - application is working as requires but i can only display the error in a normal alert not a bootstrap one!
13-9-2021 2am  - location works fine with error detection but the weather feature still have problems!
14-9-2021 1am  - Weather works just fine and movies as well on local device only!
